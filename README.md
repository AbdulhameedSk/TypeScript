### 1. Strongly typed vs loosely typed

The terms `strongly typed` and `loosely typed` refer to how programming languages handle types, particularly how strict they are about type conversions and type safety.

#### Strongly typed languages

1. **Examples:** Java, C++, C, Rust
2. **Benefits:**
   1. Lesser runtime errors
   2. Stricter codebase
   3. Easy to catch errors at compile time

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int number = 10;
  number = "text"; // Compilation error: cannot convert 'const char [5]' to 'int' in assignment
  return 0;
}
```

#### Loosely typed languages

1. **Examples:** Python, JavaScript, Perl, PHP
2. **Benefits:**
   1. Easy to write code
   2. Fast to bootstrap
   3. Low learning curve

```javascript
function main() {
  let number = 10;
  number = "text"; // No compilation error
  return number;
}
```

People realized that JavaScript is a very powerful language but lacks types. TypeScript was introduced as a new language to add `types` on top of JavaScript.

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict `syntactical superset` of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

### 2. Where/How does TypeScript code run?

TypeScript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand `JavaScript`.

1. JavaScript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runs in your browser/Node.js runtime).
2. TypeScript is something that compiles down to JavaScript.
3. When TypeScript is compiled down to JavaScript, you get `type checking` (similar to C++). If there is an error, the conversion to JavaScript fails.

### How to Run TypeScript Code:

1. **Install TypeScript compiler (`tsc`):**
   ```
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

2. **Initialize an empty Node.js project with TypeScript:**
   ```
   mkdir node-app
   cd node-app
   npm init -y
   npx tsc --init
   ```

3. **Create a `.ts` file:**
   ```
   const x: number = 1;
   console.log(x);
   ```

4. **Compile the TypeScript file to JavaScript:**
   ```
   tsc -b
   ```

5. **Explore the generated JavaScript file.**

### 3. Basic TypeScript Concepts

#### 3.1 Types

TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, allowing developers to define types for variables, parameters, return values, and more.

```typescript
let name: string = "John";
let age: number = 30;
let isActive: boolean = true;
```

#### 3.2 Functions

Functions in TypeScript can have typed parameters and return values.

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}
```

#### 3.3 Arrays

Arrays in TypeScript can be typed to ensure they contain elements of a specific type.

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let names: string[] = ["John", "Doe", "Alice"];
```

#### 3.4 Objects

Objects in TypeScript can have defined shapes using interfaces or types.

```typescript
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

let person: Person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
```

#### 3.5 Union and Intersection Types

TypeScript supports union types (values of multiple types) and intersection types (combination of multiple types).

```typescript
let mixed: string | number = "hello";
let combined: number & string = 10;
```

### 4. TypeScript Compiler

The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) transforms TypeScript code into JavaScript code that can be executed in a browser or Node.js environment. It performs type checking, emits JavaScript files, and provides configuration options via `tsconfig.json`.

### 5. Basic TypeScript Applications

Basic TypeScript applications demonstrate how to use TypeScript features such as types, functions, classes, and modules to build simple projects, such as command-line tools, web applications, or libraries.

### 6. TypeScript in Node.js

TypeScript can be used to develop server-side applications with Node.js. By writing TypeScript code and using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`), developers can leverage the benefits of static typing, type checking, and modern JavaScript features in Node.js projects.

### 7. TypeScript and React

TypeScript can be integrated with React to create type-safe and maintainable web applications. By using TypeScript with React, developers can enforce type checks, improve code readability, and catch errors at compile time, leading to more robust and scalable React applications.

### 8. Advanced TypeScript Concepts

#### 8.1 Implementing Interfaces

Interfaces in TypeScript define the structure of objects, providing a way to describe the shape of data.

```typescript
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

class Student implements Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

#### 8.2 Using Types

Types in TypeScript allow developers to define custom type aliases, providing a way to reuse complex type definitions across multiple parts of the codebase.

```typescript
type Point = {
    x: number;
    y: number;
};

let point: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
```

#### 8.3 Enums

Enums in TypeScript allow developers to define a set of named constants, providing a way to represent a group of related values as a single data type.

```typescript
enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right
}

let move: Direction = Direction.Up;
```

#### 8.4 Generics

Generics in TypeScript enable developers to create reusable, type-safe components by parameterizing types within functions, classes, and interfaces.

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}

let value: number = identity<number>(10);
```

### 9. Modules in TypeScript

Modules in TypeScript provide a way to organize and structure code into reusable components, allowing developers to encapsulate functionality and manage dependencies more effectively. TypeScript supports both ES6-style modules (`import` and `export`) and CommonJS-style modules (`require` and `module.exports`).
